## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me understand CSS spacing much better, like paddings and margins, and helped me understand more about Flexbox and Grid layout. Despite being a simple project, I was able to learn valuable lessons from it.

### Continued development

I intend to continue improving my skills with Flexbox and Grid, and my design skills based on Frontend Mentor projects.
